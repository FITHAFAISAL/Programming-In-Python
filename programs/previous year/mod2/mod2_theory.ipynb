    "Q.Compare and contrast the fundamental characteristics and use cases of lists,tuples, and sets in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Lists\n",
    "A list is an ordered, mutable collection that allows duplicate elements. Lists are widely used for storing sequences of items where modification, indexing, and iteration are required.\n",
    "\n",
    "Characteristics:\n",
    "Ordered (maintains the insertion order).\n",
    "Mutable (can be modified after creation).\n",
    "Allows duplicate elements.\n",
    "Supports indexing and slicing.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Tuples\n",
    "A tuple is an ordered, immutable collection that allows duplicate elements. Tuples are useful when data should remain unchanged throughout the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Characteristics:\n",
    "Ordered (maintains the insertion order).\n",

    "Allows duplicate elements.\n",
    "Supports indexing and slicing.\n",
    "More memory-efficient and faster than lists.\n",

    "Unordered (does not maintain the insertion order).\n",

    "List: A list is an ordered, mutable collection of elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuple: A tuple is an ordered, immutable collection of elements.\n",

    "2. Syntax\n",
    "List: Defined using square brackets [].\n",

    "my_tuple[1] = 10  # TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment\n",

    "List: Slightly slower due to mutability.\n",

    "5. Memory Usage\n",
    "List: Requires more memory since it supports dynamic modifications.\n",

    "Tuple: More memory-efficient.\n",
